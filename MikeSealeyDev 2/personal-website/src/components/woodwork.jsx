                    While life can be chaotic at times, I like to steal a moment or two and hide away in the workshop. Since the Christmas of 2022 when I found a mini lathe waiting for me under the tree, I've thoroughly enjoyed teaching myself how to make and build various items from a simple bowl or incense burner to a coffee table.

                    This coffee table is made from a slice of a sycamore tree where the trunk began to bifurcate, and shows two distinct growth-ring patterns, giving it a completely unique appearance.

                    Still in the lathe chuck, resting on an oak slab in the workshop, is an oak bowl turned from green wood felled a few months earlier.  This bowl was my first exploration into speeding up the wood drying process by microwaving the moisture out. 6 months on it has stabilised and only suffered minimal warping.

                    Hygge is a word in Danish and Norwegian that describes a cosy, contented mood evoked by comfort and conviviality. From Denmark and Norway to Wales, I'm channelling hygge vibes with the tranquillity of this incense burner, and the gentle flicker of a candle flame dancing around this cherry-wood bowl.
