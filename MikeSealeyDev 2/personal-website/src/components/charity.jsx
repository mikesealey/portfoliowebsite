                <h2>Andy's Man Club</h2>
                <p className="project-details">Andy's Man Club is a charity devoted to men's mental health. We offer peer support via talking groups every night to help men open up about their feelings.  I first attended AMC in 2022 during a particularly rough patch. The group helped me understand and deal with the challenges I was facing.

                In the spring of 2023 I was approached by the team and invited to come onboard as a volunteer facilitator, to help run the meetings and offer support to new and existing group members.

                <h2>Ben Rawson Exhibition Match</h2>
                <p className="project-details">
                    As an active member of Northop Hall Hockey Club, I organised a charity fundraiser to help buy a prosthetic blade for a fellow hockey player and member of a rival club Denbigh HC.

                    Ben lost his leg after a cancer diagnosis, but is determined to get back to playing hockey as soon as possible.
